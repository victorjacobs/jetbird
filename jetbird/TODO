note: these are all very rough ideas.

Tidus:
- possibly implement trackback? (http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/docs/trackback_spec)
- make jetbird someday modular, although it is already a bit modular
- make a framework to allow plugins (opensocial??)
	after some googling i found this: http://coding.derkeiler.com/pdf/Archive/PHP/php.general/2007-08/msg00310.pdf
	could be useful
- dynamic template generator? (XML,...)
 
resources:  http://www.phppatterns.com seems to have some good resources on patterns.

Vikking:
- make database_handler work with other types of databases
	three options:
		- build an abstract class of database_handler + let other files implement core_* functions
			that just link to the specific database functions
			>> this produces a lot of overhead, but we still have control over what data comes out
				of our functions, avoiding broken code
		- build an abstract class of database_handler + only make very basic functions final
			>> we don't have any control over what data comes out of the db_handler functions
		- make use of the fact that all database functions have similar names:
			mysql			<> frontbase
			mysql_connect() <> fbsql_connect()
			mysql_query()	<> fbsql_query()
			...				<> ...
- find a better way to get file mimes, we now just use $_FILES['file_type'] and that's not safe
	since it's based on the file's extension
	>> there is a PECL package called fileinfo that does just that, but we don't want Jetbird to
		depend on external packages (http://pecl.php.net/package/Fileinfo)
		>> fileinfo will be part of PHP starting from version 5.3.0
- make the attachment uploader produce thumbnails of image files
	>> problem is that when using standard GD functions, exif info is destroyed
	>> we need to get the file mime thing right before trying this, could have weird consequences
